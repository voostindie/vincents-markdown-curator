# Vincent's Markdown Curator - vmc

This is a Java application on top of my [markdown-curator](https://github.com/voostindie/markdown-curator) framework that contains all the specifics for my own Markdown repositories (Obsidian vaults). I have 3 of them:

1. Rabobank (work)
2. TweeVV (volunteering)
3. Personal (personal)

The code in this repository is not private; it only contains queries on top of my content, not the content itself. 

That also means the code is pretty much worthless to anybody, except maybe that it can serve as an example of what can be done with the `markdown-curator` framework. Which is why I made it public anyway.
